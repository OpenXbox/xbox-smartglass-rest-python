# [DEPRECATED] Xbox-Smartglass-REST

## META PACKAGE
This package is deprecated and won't receive any updates.

Its codebase has moved into the core library.

You can still install this meta package - it will simply install the core library
as its only dependency then.

### Core library:

[GitHub](https://github.com/OpenXbox/xbox-smartglass-core-python)

[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/xbox-smartglass-core)
